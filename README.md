*ecoCode* is a collective project aiming to reduce environmental footprint of software at the code level. The goal of the project is to provide a list of static code analyzers to highlight code structures that may have a negative ecological impact: energy and resources over-consumption, "fatware", shortening terminals' lifespan, etc.

ecoCode is based on evolving catalogs of [good practices](docs/rules), for various technologies. A SonarQube plugin then implement these catalogs as rules for scanning your projects.

**Warning**: this is still a very early stage project. Any feedback or contribution will be highly appreciated. Please refer to the contribution section.
